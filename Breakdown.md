# Grace Shopper Breakdown

## Tier 1: MVP Shopping Experience

###### As a customer/visitor, I want to be able to:

- [ ] access a deployed version of the website so I can browse and purchase products.

- [ ] view all available products so I can pick from a variety.

- [ ] view a single product so I can see more details.

- [ ] add a product to my cart so I can collect my desired products in one place.

- [ ] edit my cart if I change my mind:

  - [ ] change the quantity of a product in my cart.
  - [ ] remove a product in my cart.
  - [ ] No one else should be able to edit my cart except me.

- [ ] "checkout" the items in my cart so I can purchase my desired goods.

  - [ ] Think of a typical user experience on popular websites from a guest user and logged-in user perspective.
  - [ ] You can just start with by simulating the experience of checking out with a simple confirmation page.

- [ ] create an account so I can have a logged-in experience.
